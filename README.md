## About
Zoot is the development name for Aprés, a mobile chat application designed to empower individuals to connect with one another in a way that is authentic, supportive and in real time. It focuses on our shared emotional realities rather than our external social media presence.
​
Aprés was designed with the busy mother in mind who may not prioritize her own social agenda, but seeks to connect with other individuals with children of the same age for affirmation and support.  

The unique ability for a user to create a thread of conversation that can be followed and expanded upon by other users allows individuals to stay connected, contribute their thoughts, and access information and support. 

Après seeks to educate, empower, and unite users to create a community of shared experience while mitigating the sense of isolation that comes with the reproductive process.
